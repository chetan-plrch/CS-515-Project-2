Get it checked by sir if undeclared variable should have the same response as the bc tool

input : /x
output : 1

1. In bc, "/x" is producing value 1, without x being declared
2. Evaluation of this expression - "(4 + 2) * (3 - 5) / 2 % 3 ^ 2" is different on bc compared to python
    a. On python it gives "3.0" (used "(4 + 2) * (3 - 5) / 2 % 3 ** 2")
    b. On bc it yields "-6" (used "(4 + 2) * (3 - 5) / 2 % 3 ^ 2")
    Now the question, should we follow bc implementation for precedence and associativity?
3. What should we do for undeclared variables?
    a. For eg: bc uses 0 as default value for undeclared variables
4. For statement, which doesn't have assignment, eg: "(-x)"
    a. Are we expected to print them (interactive way where it computes and prints)
        eg: 5 (giving just 5 as statement, should make it print on the console?)
5. Do we need to handle cases for unary minus (-) like these one
    a. x = x + -x (The -x is without braces)
    b. x = x +-x (Without spacing between "+" and "-x")
    We can handle these though
        a. x = x + (-x) (This makes sense though)
        b. x = x + -(-x) (This makes sense though)


print based checkups like x=x+1

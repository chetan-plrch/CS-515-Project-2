## Estimated Man Hours : 80 hours ( combining both bandwidth ) 
We also worked in shifts in with majority of time in overlapping

## Testing 
Some non typicaly function were tested using doctest, then after a functionality was created then we created custom scripts which were used. 

you can run the scripts in the repo. 

We created a exhaustive list of expression and run on it, you find the exhaustive list in expression.txt 

we also created the following docs to test specefic expression, this is difficult list


## Bugs
The binary not is having some problems, and there is less time to solve this as a result, can't commply with the standards of it. BUT rest of the code and extensions
are working fine
